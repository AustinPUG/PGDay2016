    "# Very Brief Demo of Numba Speedup inside PostgreSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was originally presented as part of a talk at PGDay Austin 2016 by Davin Potts (davin AT discontinuity DOT net).\n",
    "\n",
    "The talk built up to this notebook by first providing stories about computer vision technologies employed by Stipple, Inc., providing pointers to how similar functionality could be implemented by others using Python+NumPy+scikit-learn, and then introducing Numba to drastically accelerate the execution of such functionality inside a postgres database (performing data-intensive computations where the data lives).\n",
    "\n",
    "Links mentioned during the talk:\n",
    "* https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/24/stipple-search-mobile/ (Overview of Stipple, Inc.)\n",
    "* http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/04/22/stipple-shuts-down-vc-backers-included-floodgate-kleiner-perkins/\n",
    "* https://vimeo.com/63258721 (Tutorial on Image Fingerprinting using scikit-learn from PyData Santa Clara 2013 also by Davin)\n",
    "* http://numba.pydata.org/ (Numba project home)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create a compute-intensive Python function, compile it using Numba inside PL/Python, then test its relative speedup."

    "### Create Compute-Intensive Python Function\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create two functions in PL/Python.  The first does the work of defining the function and even compiling it with Numba.  The second performs a speedtest to compare the pure-Python version of the function with the Numba compiled version of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagining a more real-world use case, the first might be a function we want to make fast and the second is perhaps the code that uses that function (which could have been conventional SQL, no Python needed)."
